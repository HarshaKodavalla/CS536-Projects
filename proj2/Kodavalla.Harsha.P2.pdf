Harsha Kodavalla - Programming Assignment 2

To compile and run the program, execute the following commands in order:

>make clean
>make cleantest
>make
>make test

Ensure to run
>make cleantest

every time after running make test. 

Running make test will cause the scanner to analyze a variety of files containing a variety of 
combinations of the cdull language. It will then check if the output of the scanner differs
from the expected output. As the testing program also checks if error messages are working 
correctly, it is important to carefully look at the output of the test file to ensure that
ONLY the correct error messages are being printed.
